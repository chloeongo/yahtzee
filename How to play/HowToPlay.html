    <h2 class="headerText">Game Rules</h2>
        <p>Each player gets a scorecard with different categories to fill in. Players take turns rolling the dice. 
          <br>
        After each roll, they can choose to keep some dice and re-roll the rest up to three times.
        They can choose which 
          <br>
        dice to keep and which to re-roll to try and achieve the best combination.
        After the third roll, 
          <br>
        the player must choose a category to score their points in.
          <br>
        Each category on the scorecard can only be used once.
        </p>


    <h2 class="headerText">Categories</h2>
        <p>
        Ones, Twos, Threes, Fours, Fives, Sixes: The player's score is the sum of the dice showing the corresponding number.
          <br>
        Three of a Kind: Three dice showing the same number, score is the sum of all dice.
          <br>
        Four of a Kind: Four dice showing the same number, score is the sum of all dice.
          <br>
        Full House: Three dice of one number and two of another, score is 25 points.
          <br>
        Small Straight: Four sequential dice (e.g., 1-2-3-4), score is 30 points.
          <br>
        Large Straight: Five sequential dice (e.g., 1-2-3-4-5), score is 40 points.
          <br>

          <br>
        Chance: Score is the sum of all dice, no specific combination required.
        </p>

    <h2 class="headerText">Scoring</h2>
        <p>
        After choosing a category, the player writes their score for that category on the scorecard.
          <br>
        If the combination achieved does not fit into any category, 
          <br>
        the player must choose an empty category to score zero or use the Chance category.
        </p>

    <h2 class="headerText">Bonus</h2>
        <p>
        Players get a bonus of 35 points if the total of their Ones through Sixes categories is 42 or higher.
        </p>

    <h2 class="headerText">End of game</h2>
        <p>
        The game ends when all players have filled in their scorecards.
          <br>
        The player with the highest total score wins.
